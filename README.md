2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (optional, you can download project from Github, button "Code" on project page)

4. [VR Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/VR%20Dashboard)

5. Python3
    For Windows please check the Microsoft App store or download the installer [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
        The location of python.exe will be determined using PATH variable.
    For others platforms please follow the instructions for your OS or download the tarball [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


## Installation

Download sail-pro from github:

```clj
$ cd <..>
$ git clone https://github.com/rururu/sail-pro.git     # optional, see above
$ cd sail-pro
```
## Usage

### 1. Project VR Dashboard Client

1. Open "Virual Regatta" page in a browser.
2. Activate "VR Dashboard" plugin. 
3. Start "sail-pro":

```clj
$ cd <..>/sail-pro
$ ./run_VR.sh 			# Linux, MacOS
$ .\run_VR.bat 	    	# Windows
```

4. Wait while programs will be loaded and expert system initialized (see a messages in the terminal).
5. If you start a new race, you will be asked for a boat name and a 3D boat model skin.
   In this case you can enter new boat name - your boat.
6. Wait until you see a view from a cockpit of the boat in a separate tab of the browser. 
   A chart view is in the program GUI.
7. In the end to save the input changes you should save a project. 

See details in screencasts. Some details can be differen of earlier - these are deprecated!

8. Use controls to create nearby boats, give them names, coordinates, speed and course. 
    You can even create an aircraft carrier and control a helicopter or a fighter.

## FAQ

1. Quick start (run_VR.sh) sometimes fails.

   Use a longer start (run.sh or run.bat) with manual loading of programs and start of the expert system:
   Menu: Protege -> (clojure-work).
   
3. When we climb aboard, we find ourselves under water.

   Climb 100 meters (Elevation: 100) or more and then descend 4 meters.
   
4. Can we restart Sail-Pro without restarting VR and VRDashboard?

   Yes, you can. And vice versa too.
   
5. How to change Fleet visibility?
   
   Set a new "Fleet visibility" value and click "Modify Instance" button.
